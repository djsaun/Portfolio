# David Saunders' Portfolio

[https://davidjsaunders.com](https://davidjsaunders.com)

The portfolio was built with React.js using the [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) static site generator and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). All site styling is created using CSS modules. 

The portfolio's homepage makes use of the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to showcase recently updated repositories and to provide an activity feed of GitHub activities.

Users can view and learn more about my personal and professional projects from the [portfolio](https://davidjsaunders.com/portfolio) page and can hear my thoughts on the front end ecosystem via my [blog](https://davidjsaunders.com/blog).
