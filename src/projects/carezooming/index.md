excerpt: "CareZooming is a medical startup backed by the Brigham and Women's Hospital system that promotes and provides resources to better improve patient care. As the sole designer and developer of this freelanced redesign project, I worked intimately with the client stakeholders to develop a site that better reflected their vision for the company. Whereas the previous iteration of the site was static and required development assistance to update content, the redesigned site's WordPress backend allows the client to more-easily upload and edit their content without third-party help. Custom tools throughout the site also allow the client and the site's users to easily filter and find relevant content on the site."
