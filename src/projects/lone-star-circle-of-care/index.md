excerpt: "As the lead developer for Monkee-Boy Web Design on the Lone Star Circle of Care site redesign, I made use of the WordPress CMS and utilized HTML, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP to build a site to the client's requirements. The site is fully responsive and accessible and features robust filtering tools for the clinic's locations and providers. Clinics can be filtered by city and service, both in map and list views, and providers can be filtered by clinic location, service, and languages spoken. The site also has custom built mega menus that highlight recent blog posts and CTAs."

This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on [salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

>A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed, wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
