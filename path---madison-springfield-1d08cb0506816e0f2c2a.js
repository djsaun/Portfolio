In Asian supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed, wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src="./salty_egg.jpg" alt="Chinese Salty Egg"></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Madison Springfield, Inc.",date:"March 01, 2016",link:"https://www.madisonspringfield.com/",repo:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/madison-springfield/"}}}});
